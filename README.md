# View-Thin-Section-Images-from-a-Porosity-Permeability-Cross-Plot-using-Python-Altair
We have used some very simple python code to view thin sections from a porosity vs. permeability cross plot using python's Altair and Pane.

This is a very simple clastic example. We read an Excel file as shown below to create a pandas DataFrame:

And then we run the Jupyter Notebook to get the following output:
